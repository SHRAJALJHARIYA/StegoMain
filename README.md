# Steganography Tool

This is a Python-based steganography tool that allows users to securely hide and extract secret messages in images using AES encryption.

## About the Project
This project combines cryptography and steganography to provide a secure way of hiding messages inside images. The hidden message is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) before being embedded into the image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. This ensures that the message remains confidential and can only be retrieved with the correct decryption key.

## Working of the Code
1. **Encryption Process:**
   - The user selects an image file.
   - The secret message is input along with an encryption key.
   - The message is encrypted using AES with the provided key.
   - The encrypted message is converted into a binary format and embedded into the image using LSB modification.
   - The modified image is saved as a new file with the hidden message.

2. **Decryption Process:**
   - The user uploads the encoded image.
   - The program extracts the binary data from the image and reconstructs the encrypted message.
   - The extracted encrypted message is decrypted using the provided key.
   - The decrypted message is displayed to the user.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Supports both 128-bit and 256-bit encryption.
- **Image Steganography**: Uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to embed messages into images.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `customtkinter` for an intuitive interface.
- **Encryption & Decryption**:
  - Upload an image and embed a secret message with AES encryption.
  - Extract and decrypt hidden messages from encoded images.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed and the required libraries:
```sh
pip install customtkinter pillow pycryptodome
```

## Usage
Run the main script:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Encryption Process:
1. Select an image (PNG format recommended).
2. Enter a secret message.
3. Provide an encryption key.
4. Choose AES encryption type (128-bit or 256-bit).
5. Click "Encrypt" to embed the encrypted message into the image.
6. The output image (`*_encoded.png`) will contain the hidden message.

### Decryption Process:
1. Upload an encoded image.
2. Enter the decryption key.
3. Select the same encryption type used for encoding.
4. Click "Decrypt" to retrieve the hidden message.
